## Documents

### h-omega-synthesis.md
**H(ω): The Configuration Constraint on Cognitive Accessibility**

The formal synthesis document presenting the main theoretical contribution: the claim that physiological configuration constrains the *set* of accessible cognitive states, not merely their probability or precision.

Key sections:
- Formal definition of H(ω)
- Synthesis of HKB coordination dynamics, Barrett's EPIC model, and the Options framework
- The metabolic interpretation of cognitive accessibility
- Clinical and applied implications

### configuration-dynamics.md
**Configuration Dynamics: The Metabolic Architecture of Flexible Cognition**

The initial working document that developed the core concepts:
- PFC as mapping-switcher
- The dynamics loop
- Precision as temperature
- Trauma as quenching, therapy as annealing
- Implications for ecological interface design

## Key Concepts

**H(ω)** — The space of accessible hypothesis/policy mappings as a function of body configuration ω

**The Configuration Constraint** — "What cannot be configured cannot be thought"

**Initiation Sets** — Following the Options framework: a mapping h is accessible at configuration ω iff ω ∈ I_h

## Relation to the Interactive App

Section 7 (Configuration Constraint) and Section 8 (Empirical Predictions) in the explorer directly implement these concepts through:

- **AnnealingSim** — Visualizes the precision/temperature dynamics, quenching, and attractor landscapes
- **ConfigurationPage** — Presents the theoretical content with interactive demonstrations
