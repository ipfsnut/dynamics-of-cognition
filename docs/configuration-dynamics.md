# Configuration Dynamics: The Metabolic Architecture of Flexible Cognition

## The Core Insight

The prefrontal cortex does not sit atop a hierarchy commanding the body below. Rather, it operates as a **mapping-switcher** — a metabolically expensive system for rapidly evaluating alternative interpretive and action mappings — whose degrees of freedom are themselves constrained by bodily configuration. What cannot be configured cannot be thought.

This reframes the relationship between "abstract" cognition and embodiment: abstraction and ratiocination are indeed virtual, in the sense that they are temporarily decoupled from immediate motor commitment. But the space of possible virtual explorations is bounded by the physical configuration of the system doing the exploring.

## Formal Structure

Let **Ω** be the space of body configurations. At any moment, the system occupies some configuration ω ∈ Ω. This configuration encompasses autonomic state, metabolic reserves, postural set, muscular tension patterns, hormonal milieu — the full physiological context.

Let **H** be the space of mappings from configurations to actions/predictions:

$$h: \Omega \rightarrow \text{Actions} \times \text{Predictions}$$

The system needs such mappings to function — to translate its current state into behavior and anticipation.

**The PFC's distinctive contribution:**

1. **Maintaining multiple candidate mappings** h₁, h₂, h₃... simultaneously in working memory
2. **Rapidly evaluating** what each mapping would yield given current ω, without committing the body
3. **Switching between mappings** to explore counterfactuals, project futures, compare outcomes
4. **Selecting and committing** — which then writes to the global workspace and reconfigures ω itself

The "virtual" quality of abstract thought is precisely this: temporarily decoupled evaluation of alternative mappings without immediately reconfiguring the body. You can "try on" different h's, see where they lead, trace their implications — without actually executing.

## The Configuration Constraint

But — and this is the crux — **the set H(ω) of accessible mappings is itself a function of ω**. You can only switch to mappings that your current bodily configuration can instantiate and support.

$$H_{accessible} = H(ω)$$

A panicked body (high sympathetic tone, amygdala dominant, cortisol-flooded) literally cannot access the mappings that require ventral vagal safety to even represent. The PFC might be "capable" of those mappings in some abstract sense, but they are not in the accessible set given current configuration.

This is not merely a performance limitation. It is a constitutive constraint on what thoughts are available.

## The Metabolic Budget

Mapping-switching is expensive. The PFC's capacity for virtual exploration draws from a shared metabolic pool with hard limits.

**Key dynamics:**

- **Exploration has a time limit**: Multiple active mappings can only be maintained briefly before the system demands commitment. This is experienced as the pressure to decide, the fatigue of deliberation.

- **Switching cost scales with distance**: Evaluating a mapping very different from your current one costs more than evaluating a nearby variant. This is why radical reframing is hard — it requires metabolic resources to even consider.

- **Depletion narrows the accessible set**: As metabolic resources deplete, H(ω) shrinks. The system falls back to well-worn, automatic, low-cost mappings. This isn't just being "tired" — it's a genuine reduction in the space of available thoughts.

- **Stress and fatigue produce rigidity**: Not because the PFC is "impaired" in some generic sense, but because the body can no longer afford the metabolic cost of maintaining and switching between alternative mappings. You collapse to the default.

## The Embodied Global Workspace

Standard Global Workspace Theory (Baars, Dehaene) treats the workspace as cortical broadcast — information becomes conscious when it's globally available to multiple brain systems. This is accurate but incomplete.

**The extension:** The workspace is the whole body.

When a mapping is selected and committed:
- It doesn't just broadcast cortically — it configures the body
- The body's configuration is itself the medium of availability
- What's "globally accessible" is what the current ω permits
- Motor readiness, autonomic tone, postural set — these aren't downstream effects of workspace broadcast, they *are* the workspace

Consciousness, in this view, is not a cortical phenomenon that happens to have bodily correlates. The body is the workspace. Configuration is availability.

## The Dynamics Loop

```
Current ω (body configuration)
           ↓
Constrains H(ω) — the accessible mapping space
           ↓
PFC explores/evaluates h ∈ H(ω) — virtual, metabolically costly
           ↓
Selects h* — commitment under time/energy pressure
           ↓
Writes to global workspace (body)
           ↓
Reconfigures ω — new configuration
           ↓
         (repeat)
```

Each cycle both expresses and modifies the constraint structure. Thinking isn't separate from bodily reconfiguration — it's the process by which one configuration gives rise to the next, mediated by virtual evaluation of alternatives.

## Precision and Temperature

Following the free energy framework, we can understand this through precision-weighting:

**Precision = inverse temperature = 1/T**

High precision (low temperature):
- System is tightly constrained to current attractor
- Mapping-switching is expensive and rare
- Strong commitment to current interpretation
- Characteristic of expertise, automaticity, stress, rigidity

Low precision (high temperature):
- System can explore freely across configuration space
- Mapping-switching is metabolically affordable
- Loose commitment, high flexibility
- Characteristic of safety, play, creativity, early learning

**Trauma as quenching:** A sudden spike in precision that freezes the system into a defensive configuration before it can explore alternatives. The mapping that was active at the moment of overwhelm becomes locked in — not because it's optimal, but because the system lost the metabolic capacity to evaluate anything else.

**Therapy as annealing:** Carefully controlled reduction in precision to allow the system to explore configurations it has been locked out of, followed by gradual re-cooling into more adaptive attractors.

## Expertise and Automaticity

Expertise development, in this view, involves:

1. **Discovery**: Identifying which mappings work for which situations
2. **Cost reduction**: Practicing mappings until their metabolic cost drops
3. **Configuration tuning**: Building body configurations (ω) that make the right H(ω) accessible by default
4. **Synergy formation**: Coupling ω and h so tightly that the mapping runs without deliberate switching

The endpoint is automaticity: the mapping executes without needing to maintain alternatives, without switching costs, without deliberation. The expert doesn't think about what to do — the right mapping is simply available given their configuration.

**The cost:** Brittleness. The expert's ω and h are so tightly coupled that they only work in the trained context. Novel situations require expensive mapping-switching that the expert may have lost practice in. This is why experts can be surprisingly rigid when conditions change — they've traded flexibility for efficiency.

## Implications for Ecological Interface Design

If the PFC's "freedom" is really the capacity for metabolically expensive mapping-switching, then genuine cognitive flexibility requires not just a capable operator but a **body configured to support exploration**.

The parasympathetic tone, the metabolic reserves, the low-threat context — these aren't background conditions for thinking. They're constitutive of the capacity to think flexibly.

**Design implications:**

1. **Interfaces assume a configuration**: Every interface design implicitly assumes operators will be in a certain physiological state (typically: alert, calm, ventral vagal, cognitively flexible). Under stress, operators may not be able to access the mappings the interface requires.

2. **Degrees of freedom are state-dependent**: The operator's available DOF aren't fixed by training and interface design alone. They're constrained by current configuration. A well-learned mapping may be inaccessible if the body is in the wrong state.

3. **Stress narrows before it impairs**: Before performance degrades in measurable ways, stress narrows the accessible mapping space. The operator can still execute familiar mappings but loses access to alternatives. This is invisible until a situation demands flexibility.

4. **Recovery is reconfiguration**: Supporting operator resilience isn't just about rest and stress reduction — it's about restoring the body configurations that make flexible cognition possible.

5. **Training should train configurations**: Expertise development shouldn't just rehearse correct responses. It should build body configurations that keep the right mapping spaces accessible under operational conditions.

## The One-Body Principle

There is no separate "cognitive" system that happens to be implemented in meat. There is one body, configured in various ways, with the capacity to rapidly and virtually evaluate alternative configurations before committing to them.

The PFC's apparent freedom is real — but it is the freedom of a system exploring its own configuration space, bounded by where it currently stands and what its metabolic resources permit it to reach.

What cannot be configured cannot be thought.
What cannot be metabolically afforded cannot be considered.
What the body cannot reach, the mind cannot access.

This is not a limitation on cognition. It is the structure of cognition itself.
